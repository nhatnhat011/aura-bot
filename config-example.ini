###  Aura doesn't actually require map files (given map config paths exist), but some features do:
###  - Automatic calculation of map config values
###  - Transfer maps to players (behind option <hosting.map_transfers.mode>.)
###
### For WC3 versions less than or equal to 1.27b, you MAY want something like
### - C:\Program Files (x86)\Warcraft III\Maps\Downloads\
### - C:\Program Files (x86)\Warcraft III\Maps\Frozen Throne\
###
### It's recommended (mandatory for 1.28 or higher) to keep a maps folder independent from the game.
### Only one map path is allowed.

### the path to the directory where the WC3 JASS files are stored
###  this directory contains common.j and blizzard.j (automatically extracted from MPQ files at game.install_path)
###  common.j and blizzard.j are required to host maps from .w3m, .w3x files, but Aura can host from existing map configs.
bot.jass_path = jass

### the path to the directory where WC3 save files are stored
###  Aura itself doesn't save games in the bot server,

### how many frames should the latency equalizer use, if enabled

### sudo keyword
###  privilege escalation for the host of the bot may be requested by typing !su COMMAND, PAYLOAD most anywhere
###  such commands must be confirmed with a command including a secret token displayed in the bot console
###  this keyword sets the confirmation command (by default sudo, which means: !sudo TOKEN COMMAND, PAYLOAD)

### - Setup a UDP reverse-proxy at 127.0.0.1:<net.game_discovery.udp.tcp6_custom_port.value>,
###   forwarding UDP traffic from <HOST IPv6 ADDRESS>:<net.game_discovery.udp.ipv6.port> to 127.0.0.1:6112.
