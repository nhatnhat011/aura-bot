# BOT CONFIGURATION #
#####################

### the path to your local Warcraft III directory
###  this path must contain war3.exe, storm.dll, and game.dll
###  if this path contains War3Patch.mpq the bot will attempt to extract "Scripts\common.j" and "Scripts\blizzard.j" on startup and write them to bot_mapcfgpath (which is defined later in this file)
###  common.j and blizzard.j are only required for automatically calculating map_crc, you do not need them if your map config files already contain map_crc

bot_war3path = wc3

### the address Aura will bind to when hosting games (leave it blank to bind to all available addresses)
###  if you don't know what this is just leave it blank

bot_bindaddress =
	 	
### the maximum number of minutes to wait for a GProxy++ client to reconnect to the game	
###  if you set this to 0 or 1 Aura will wait for up to 1 minute	 	
###  if you set this to 10 or more Aura will only wait for up to 10 minutes
###  due to the way GProxy++ works, increasing this value increases bandwidth requirements and CPU requirements on the players' computers
###  players can always vote to drop a player who is lagging after waiting 45 seconds regardless of this value
	
bot_reconnectwaittime = 0

### maximum number of games to host at once

bot_maxgames = 5

### command trigger for ingame only (battle.net command triggers are defined later)

bot_commandtrigger = !

### the path to the directory where you keep your map config files
###  this directory can also contain common.j and blizzard.j (extracted from War3Patch.mpq)
###  common.j and blizzard.j are only required for automatically calculating map_crc, you do not need them if your map config files already contain map_crc

bot_mapcfgpath = mapcfgs

bot_listmapcfg = 28 31 w3ce rf

### the path to the directory where you keep your map files
###  Aura doesn't require map files but if it has access to them it can send them to players and automatically calculate most map config values
###  Aura will search [bot_mappath + map_localpath] for the map file (map_localpath is set in each map's config file)

bot_mappath = maps

### whether to automatically lock games when the owner joins

bot_autolock = 0

### whether to allow map downloads or not
###  set to 0 to disable map downloads
###  set to 1 to enable map downloads
###  set to 2 to enable conditional map downloads (an admin must start each map download with the !download or !dl command)

bot_allowdownloads = 0

### the maximum number of players allowed to download the map at the same time

bot_maxdownloaders = 5

### the maximum combined download speed of all players downloading the map (in KB/sec)

bot_maxdownloadspeed = 50000

### use LC style pings (divide actual pings by two)

### auto kick players with ping higher than this

bot_autokickping = 400

### automatically close the game lobby if a reserved player (or admin) doesn't join it for this many minutes

bot_lobbytimelimit = 10

### the game latency
###  this can always be changed for a particular game with the !latency command (which enforces a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 500)

bot_latency = 45

### the maximum number of packets a player is allowed to get out of sync by before starting the lag screen
###  this can always be changed for a particular game with the !synclimit command (which enforces a minimum of 10 and a maximum of 10000)

bot_synclimit = 10000

### the percentage of players required to vote yes for a votekick to pass
###  the player starting the votekick is assumed to have voted yes and the player the votekick is started against is assumed to have voted no
###  the formula for calculating the number of votes needed is votes_needed = ceil( ( num_players - 1 ) * bot_votekickpercentage / 100 )
###  this means it will round UP the number of votes required
###  if you set it to 100 it will require 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8, 8/9, 9/10, 10/11, and 11/12 votes to pass
###  if you set it to 90 it will require 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8, 8/9, 9/10, 9/11, and 10/12 votes to pass
###  if you set it to 80 it will require 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 4/6, 5/7, 6/8, 7/9, 8/10, 8/11, and 9/12 votes to pass
###  if you set it to 70 it will require 2/3, 3/4, 3/5, 4/6, 5/7, 5/8, 6/9, 7/10, 7/11, and 8/12 votes to pass
###  if you set it to 60 it will require 2/3, 2/4, 3/5, 3/6, 4/7, 5/8, 5/9, 6/10, 6/11, and 7/12 votes to pass

# LAN CONFIGURATION #
#####################

### the Warcraft 3 version to use when broadcasting LAN games

lan_war3version = 28

### 0/1 use support bonjour LAN games

### place 1 if use war reforged


### the UDP broadcast target
###  if this value is blank the bot will try to broadcast LAN games on the default interface which is chosen by your operating system
###  sometimes your operating system will choose the wrong interface when more than one exists
###  therefore you can use this value to force the bot to use a specific interface
###  for example you may set it to 192.168.1.255 to broadcast LAN games to the 192.168.1.x subnet
###  also if you want to broadcast to a connected Hamachi network set it to 5.255.255.255

# BATTLE.NET CONFIGURATION #

### which battle.net server to connect to
###  1.) useast.battle.net
###  2.) uswest.battle.net
###  3.) asia.battle.net
###  4.) europe.battle.net
###  5.) server.eurobattle.net (this is a PvPGN)

### note that each banned player is tied to the realm it was created on and the realm is case sensitive
### so if you change your realm from useast.battle.net to USEAST.BATTLE.NET it'll still connect but anyone previously banned will not be counted as banned until you change it back

### your Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos CD key

### the locale specifies the area of the world you are from
###  battle.net uses this to group players together, showing them games hosted by players and bots mostly from their own area
###  it's important to set this to the correct value to increase the effectiveness of the game refresher
###  if you are using Windows you can set this to "system" to use the locale of your system
###  otherwise you can use the list at the following URL to get the correct value for your area:
###  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0h88fahh%28VS.85%29.aspx
###  put the "decimal value" here, e.g. 1031 is the default for "German - Germany"
###  note: you cannot use a value of "system" on Linux, doing so will use a default value of 1031 instead
